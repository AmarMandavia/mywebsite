Automated speech analysis using natural language processing (NLP) has the potential to improve diagnostics and prognostic measures for psychotic disorders.

The Rorschach Performance Assessment System (R-PAS) provides a structured procedure for gathering speech samples from Rorschach inkblot test; a meta-analytically supported [Mihura et al., 2013](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2012-23139-001) reliable and valid measure of psychotic symptoms, such as disorganized thinking. 

In collaboration with [Joni Mihura](https://www.utoledo.edu/al/psychology/people/faculty/mihura.html), this study examines the clinical validity of NLP-derived measures of positive and negative thought disorder symptoms in a forensic population. The findings should provide clinicians with a more efficient and objective alternative to hand-scoring Rorschach protocols for disordered thinking.
