              Little is known about how emotion dysregulation (ED) and trauma exposure differentially affect the relationship between abuse in childhood and adult substance use. We examined associations between child abuse, trauma exposure, ED, and current substance use in an already existing dataset. Participants (
              N
              = 2,014 adults, 90\% African American) had been recruited from an urban hospital for a parent study. Analyses showed that drug and alcohol use was significantly positively correlated with child abuse (emotional, physical, and sexual), later trauma exposure, and ED (all
              p
              s {\textless} .001). Linear regression showed that exposure to abuse when older than a child was significantly associated with drug and alcohol use independent of child abuse and demographic variables (

              Δ = .04,
              p
              {\textless} .001). ED was significantly associated with drug and alcohol use independently of child abuse, nonabuse trauma, and demographic variables (
              R
              2
              Δ = .02,

              Δ = .04,
              p
              {\textless} .001). Multiple mediation analyses showed that ED and later trauma exposure accounted for variance in the association between emotional abuse and substance use (
              p
              {\textless} .001). A better understanding of vulnerabilities to additional traumatization and emotion‐regulation deficits in individuals who have been exposed to child abuse and in addition have comorbid substance use problems may inform treatments that lead to improved outcomes.

            Regulación Emocional como mediador de la niñez
            
              Poco se sabe acerca de cómo la disregulación emocional (DE) y el trauma afectan diferencialmente la relación entre el maltrato en la infancia y el consumo de sustancias en la adultez. Se examinaron las asociaciones entre el maltrato infantil, la exposición al trauma, la disregulación emocional y el uso de sustancias actual en un conjunto de datos ya existente. Los participantes (N = 2.014 adultos, 90\% afroamericanos) habían sido reclutados en un hospital urbano para un estudio parental. Los resultados fueron que las drogas y el alcohol se correlacionaron significativamente con el maltrato infantil (emocional, físico y sexual), exposición a trauma posterior y disregulación emocional (todos los p {\textless} .001). La regresión lineal mostró que la exposición al maltrato cuando se es mayor, más que cuando se es niño, se asoció significativamente con uso de drogas y alcohol independiente del maltrato infantil y de las variables demográficas (R
              2
              Δ = .08, p {\textless} .001; R
              2
              Δ = .04, p {\textless} .001). La disregulación emocional se asoció significativamente con el consumo de drogas y alcohol, independientemente del maltrato infantil, el trauma no causado por maltrato y las variables demográficas (R
              2
              Δ = .02, p {\textless} .001; R
              2
              Δ = .04, p {\textless} .001). Los análisis de mediación múltiples mostraron que la disregulación emocional y la exposición a trauma posterior contribuyeron a la varianza en la relación entre el maltrato emocional y el consumo de sustancias (p {\textless} .001). Una mejor comprensión de ambas vulnerabilidades, a la traumatización adicional y al déficit de regulación emocional, pueden dar mejor información a los tratamientos que tienen mejores resultados en los individuos que han estado expuestos a maltrato infantil y, que además, tienen problemas de consumo de sustancias comórbidos.

              Background
              Recent research has identified a number of pre-traumatic, peri-traumatic and post-traumatic psychological and ecological factors that put an individual at increased risk for developing PTSD following a life-threatening event. While these factors have been found to be associated with PTSD in univariate analyses, the complex interactions of these risk factors and how they contribute to individual trajectories of the illness are not yet well understood. In this study, we examine the impact of prior trauma, psychopathology, sociodemographic characteristics, community and environmental information, on PTSD onset in a nationally representative sample of adults in the United States, using machine learning methods to establish the relative contributions of each variable.
            
            
              Methods
              
                Individual risk factors identified in Waves 1 of the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC) were combined with community-level data for the years concurrent to the NESARC Wave 1 (
                n
                 = 43,093) and 2 (
                n
                 = 34,653) surveys. Machine learning feature selection and classification analyses were used at the national level to create models using individual- and community-level variables that would best predict the new onset of PTSD at Wave 2.
              
            
            
              Results
              Our classification algorithms yielded 89.7 to 95.6\% accuracy for predicting new onset of PTSD at Wave 2. A prior diagnosis of DSM-IV-TR Borderline Personality Disorder, Major Depressive Disorder or Anxiety Disorder conferred the greatest relative influence in new diagnosis of PTSD. Distal risk factors such as prior psychiatric diagnosis accounted for significantly greater relative risk than proximal factors (such as adverse event exposure).
            
            
              Conclusions
              Our findings show that a machine learning classification approach can successfully integrate large numbers of known risk factors for PTSD into stronger models that account for high-dimensional interactions and collinearity between variables. We discuss the implications of these findings as pertaining to the targeted mobilization emergency mental health resources. These findings also inform the creation of a more comprehensive risk assessment profile to the likelihood of developing PTSD following an extremely adverse event.},

	abstract = {Treatment as usual has historically been used as control arms for randomized controlled trials (RCTs), but utilizing wellness interventions as active comparison conditions can advance the evidence base of such interventions while increasing access to health promotion content. We use the results from the CONNECT 2 RCT's wellness intervention control arm as a case example of active comparison conditions that can control for dosage or attentional effects in future research. We summarized existing studies on wellness control HIV RCT interventions, introduced CONNECT 2, and discussed recruitment, randomization, and the intervention. Overall, Wellness Promotion participants were more likely to engage in physical activity, eat healthier, and do more vigorous exercise when compared with HIV Risk Reduction. CONNECT 2 Wellness intervention results solidify why wellness interventions can play an important role in treatment guidelines. Developing and implementing this model can be a more ethical, equitable, and holistic approach among underserved communities.},
